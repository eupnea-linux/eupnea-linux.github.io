# Supported Devices

All 64-bit Intel/AMD (x64) Chromebooks are able to at least boot Eupnea. Audio support varies from non existent to full support. Currently Intel is developing [AVS](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-5.19-Sound). As soon as AVS fully releases, all Intel Chromebooks should get audio support out-of-the-box.
